# Hands-on [[hands-on]]

Now that you've learned to use Optuna, here are some ideas to apply what you've learned:

1️⃣ **Beat your LunarLander-v2 agent results**, by using Optuna to find a better set of hyperparameters. You can also try with another environment, such as MountainCar-v0 and CartPole-v1.

2️⃣ **Beat your SpaceInvaders agent results**.

By doing this, you'll see how valuable and powerful Optuna can be in training better agents.

Have fun!
